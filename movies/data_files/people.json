In 1992, he helped form Image Comics, pulling the occult anti-hero character Spawn from his high school portfolio and updating him for the 1990s. Spawn was a popular hero in the 1990s and encouraged a trend in creator-owned comic book properties.\n\nSince leaving inking duties on Spawn with issue #70 (February 1998), McFarlane has illustrated comic books less often, focusing on entrepreneurial efforts, such as McFarlane Toys and Todd McFarlane Entertainment, a film and animation studio. In September, 2006, it was announced that McFarlane will be the Art Director of the newly formed 38 Studios, formerly Green Monster Games, founded by major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. McFarlane used to be co-owner of National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers but sold his shares to Daryl Katz. He's also a high-profile collector of history-making baseballs.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Todd McFarlane, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":1.466,"place_of_birth":"Calgary, Alberta, Canada","profile_path":"/bejL1CON9O8SLxr5iBDlMyumW8n.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0568825","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1778011,"name":"Mike Zeck","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":2.257,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1974-10-31","known_for_department":"Directing","deathday":null,"id":91268,"name":"Ruben Fleischer","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"Ruben Samuel Fleischer (born October 31, 1974) is an American film director, film producer, television producer, music video director, and commercial director who lives in Los Angeles.

He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP's since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience.

She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname \"Cobie\".\n\nSmulders worked in modeling, which she later said she \"kind of hated\", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: \"You know you go into these rooms, and I've had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that. But then it was like, 'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice, and I have to have thoughts now'\".After she quit modeling, she registered at the University of Victoria to study marine biology. During the summer, she took acting classes and decided to pursue her acting career.\n\nSmulders' first acting role was as a guest in the Showtime science fiction series Jeremiah, and she has appeared in several television series since, including a recurring role in The L Word. On the New York stage, she has performed in Love, Loss, and What I Wore from at least June 10 to June 27, 2010. Her first permanent series role was in the short-lived ABC series Veritas: The Quest, and her second was television reporter Robin Scherbatsky on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother which quickly became popular. Joss Whedon has suggested that he considered her for the role of Wonder Woman in his draft of the eponymous film, which did not go into production.

Jack Kirby (August 28, 1917 – February 6, 1994),  born Jacob Kurtzberg, was an American comic book artist, writer and editor. Growing up poor in New York City, Kurtzberg entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s. He drew various comic strips under different pen names, ultimately settling on Jack Kirby. In 1941, Kirby and writer Joe Simon created the highly successful superhero character Captain America for Timely Comics. During the 1940s, Kirby would create a number of comics for various publishers, often teaming with Simon.\n\nAfter serving in World War II, Kirby returned to comics and worked in a variety of genres. He contributed to a number of publishers, including Archie Comics and DC Comics, but ultimately found himself at Timely's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, later to be known as Marvel Comics. In the 1960s, Kirby co-created many of Marvel Comics' major characters, including the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and the Hulk, along with writer-editor Stan Lee. Despite the high sales and critical acclaim of the Lee-Kirby titles, Kirby felt treated unfairly, and left the company in 1970 for rival DC Comics.\n\nWhile working for DC, Kirby created his Fourth World saga, which spanned several comics titles. While these and other titles proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled, several of their characters and the Fourth World mythos have continued as a significant part of the DC Comics universe. Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s, then ventured into television animation and independent comics. In his later years, Kirby received great recognition for his career accomplishments, and is regarded by historians and fans as one of the major innovators and most influential creators in the comic book medium.\n\nIn 1987, Kirby, along with Carl Barks and Will Eisner, was one of the three inaugural inductees of the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jack Kirby, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":1.388,"place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, USA","profile_path":"/xLVSa7mX1BCyVoKD2wyRGEQXj8M.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0456158","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1969-12-31","known_for_department":"Camera","deathday":null,"id":967026,"name":"Trent Opaloch","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":"Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada","profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1022001","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1967-08-24","known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","deathday":null,"id":10970,"name":"Judianna Makovsky","also_known_as":[],"gender":1,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/fdRHxR0k3b95mY8p3VOzFTFN2p9.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0538721","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":5551,"name":"Christopher Markus","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":2.26,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/tyeKi52yruPdxOkEMKhBKCnkp5V.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1321655","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1949-10-09","known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1713975,"name":"Jim Starlin","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.677,"place_of_birth":"Detroit, Michigan, USA","profile_path":"/r92EWrlL4EI1aMpEjWN9xjfrJ40.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":7232,"name":"Sarah Finn","also_known_as":[" Sarah Halley Finn"],"gender":1,"biography":"","popularity":1.018,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0278168","homepage":null},{"birthday":"2018-05-01","known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":32349,"name":"Charles Wood","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/lxhuwWMdbvuPzher5TSdGFsel1S.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0939605","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":1388848,"name":"Jim Barr","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/myLNBZXXESp1YzDkBoKQX8g4Yup.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm2610014","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1964-01-01","known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":1322017,"name":"Jann K.

Her best-known roles are the redeemable bad girls in Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx and Jet Li's Black Mask. The critical and financial success of Rumble in the Bronx (and its subsequent number-one box-office bow in the United States) made Yip an instant success and garnered her two Hong Kong Film Award nominations. She continued to do movies and star in TV, but her roles were less known or temporary. The characters she plays often get killed or serve as a background character. Yip appeared in the television series Andromeda as two different characters. Her first character was arrested, and her final character was murdered. She did two movies with Jet Li, the first as a lead romantic interest in Black Mask and the second in Romeo Must Die, but this time she played a Chinese gangster motorcycle assassin killed by Jet Li and Aaliyah. An unfortunate aspect of her career is that none of the TV shows she starred in lasted beyond a full season, and if she did have a starring role in a movie it was a straight-to-video/DVD film. Her most recent appearance was in the new Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem movie, and she guest-starred in the Canadian TV show Blood Ties.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article   Françoise Fong-Wa Yip, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":2.216,"place_of_birth":"North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","profile_path":"/6TllaFxiYl6j5l5rmnbAIGInaPJ.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0948123","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1978-01-14","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":62913,"name":"Sage Brocklebank","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.98,"place_of_birth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","profile_path":"/fBSTmz2FKyXmLRq67MV162xdkkw.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1242613","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":110476,"name":"Sean O.

He went on to study classical music at St. Paul's Cathedral Choir School, Eton College, Framlingham College and Oxford University. As a teenager, he became heavily influenced by the underground rave scene, and he began producing chart-topping dance remixes, electronica and club music soon afterwards.  Over the next few years, Jackman built a successful career in the recording industry, not only releasing 3 acclaimed solo albums, but also co-writing, mixing, producing, and programming with a host of outstanding artists. Jackman wrote, mixed and produced albums and songs for Seal and Art of Noise. He co-wrote songs for the films The Family Man and Anastasia. He produced songs with Gary Barlow from Take That (which reached no. 3 in the UK Charts) and Justin. He programmed for artists Mike Oldfield, Marc Almond, Coolio and Kirsty McColl. He even collaborated with Andy Gardner (of Plump DJ's fame) to produce a series of Dance Remixes that topped the dance charts and were selected for Pete Tong's Essential selection. In 2006, Jackman's accomplishments garnered the attention of Hans Zimmer and John Powell, who soon hired Jackman to compose additional music on such films as The Dark Knight, The Da Vinci Code, Kung Fu Panda and the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Jackman's first major solo scoring gig was Monsters and Aliens in 2009, a family movie with a heavy action score, and began his fruitful career as one of the most sought after composers today. Jackman's recent film scores span across a wide range of genres, from action films to period dramas to family films, including: Captain Phillips, X-Men: First Class, Henri 4, Wreck-It Ralph, Puss In Boots , Kick Ass, Turbo, This is the End, G.I.

After performing in the rock music scene of New York City's Lower East Side in 2003 and later enrolling at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, she soon signed with Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records. During her early time at Interscope, she worked as a songwriter for fellow label artists and captured the attention of recording artist Akon, who recognized her vocal abilities, and signed her to his own label, Kon Live Distribution.\n\nGaga came to prominence following the release of her debut studio album The Fame (2008), which was a critical and commercial success and achieved international popularity with the singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The album reached number one on the record charts of six countries, topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart while simultaneously peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and accomplished positions within the top ten worldwide. Achieving similar worldwide success, The Fame Monster (2009), its follow-up, produced a further two global chart-topping singles \"Bad Romance\" and \"Telephone\" and allowed her to embark on her second global concert tour, The Monster Ball Tour, just months after having finished her first, The Fame Ball Tour. Her second studio album Born This Way, released in May 2011, topped the charts in all major musical markets, after the arrival of its eponymous lead single \"Born This Way\", which achieved the number-one spot in countries worldwide and was the fastest-selling single in the history of iTunes, selling one million copies in five days.\n\nInspired by glam rock artists like David Bowie, Elton John and Queen, as well as pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson, Gaga is well-recognized for her outré sense of style in fashion, in performance and in her music videos. Her contributions to the music industry have garnered her numerous achievements including five Grammy Awards, among twelve nominations; two Guinness World Records; and the estimated sale of 15 million albums and 51 million singles worldwide. Billboard named her the Artist of the Year in 2010, ranking her as the 73rd Artist of the 2000s decade. Gaga has been included in Time magazine's annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world as well as being listed in a number of Forbes' annual lists including the 100 most powerful and influential celebrities in the world and attained the number one spot on their annual list of the 100 most powerful celebrities..\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Lady Gaga, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":4.876,"place_of_birth":"New York City - New York - USA","profile_path":"/4VogV8IgKrFYoVyjNuu5la1oMNp.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm3078932","homepage":"http://www.ladygaga.com/"},{"birthday":"1944-08-09","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":16431,"name":"Sam Elliott","also_known_as":["Samuel Pack Elliott "],"gender":2,"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSamuel Pack \"Sam\" Elliott (born August 9, 1944) is an American actor.\n\nHis rangy physique, thick horseshoe moustache, and deep, resonant voice (with a Western twang/drawl) match the iconic image of a cowboy or rancher, and he has often been cast in such roles.","popularity":2.37,"place_of_birth":"Sacramento, California, USA","profile_path":"/f2AxZZ6d0Cit0tmf6wYTHcGfwT9.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000385","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1957-09-29","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":57906,"name":"Andrew Dice Clay","also_known_as":["Andrew Clay Silverstein "],"gender":0,"biography":"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  \n\nAndrew Dice Clay (born Andrew Clay Silverstein; September 29, 1957) is an American comedian and actor.

He is loved by some and reviled by others, who feel that his act is crude, misogynistic, racist, homophobic and degrading. Clay has been widely opposed by women's rights groups and he has been banned from many radio and television shows for his explicit language and politically incorrect humor. MTV banned him for life in 1989 for reciting what he called \"adult nursery rhymes\" during the annual Video Music Awards ceremony (September 6, 1989). The next year, when he was invited to guest host the weekly comedy TV show, Saturday Night Live, cast member Nora Dunn declared her refusal to ever appear on the same broadcast as Clay and did not participate in the episode of his guest appearance (May 12). Invited musical guest Sinéad O'Connor also boycotted Clay's appearance. Clay is known for playing the lead role in the film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Clay has been in several movies and has put out many stand-up albums, including the triple-album Filth. He is the only comedian in history to sell out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row, a feat he accomplished in 1990.

In-between his movie work, he's amassed a large number of television credits.

Moore","John Daniel Evermore","JD Evermore"],"gender":2,"biography":"J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.\n\nAfter a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play \"Dylan's Ghost\" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature Glorious Mail(2005).\n\nEven though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist's print worth $80.

Mahoney","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"Brian made the decision to become an actor before his 10th birthday but took another 20 years to make the journey to Hollywood to begin his formal acting training.\n\nBorn in Framingham MA, Brian moved with his family to Illinois and Ohio before settling in a beautiful small town in Western Michigan. Unable to afford theater training after high school and in the middle of the Iranian hostage crisis he joined the US Army in hopes of later attending American Academy of Dramatic Arts in NYC.\n\nThe Army had different plans for Brian and after 2 yrs of infantry training, accepted him into US Army flight school at Ft Rucker, Alabama. Brian loved the intense academic environment and found he had a natural ability flying helicopters. Upon flight school graduation, Brian was accepted into the attack school where he was trained as a Cobra pilot then sent to a discreet Army base in the rural fields west of Nurnberg, Germany. The only American living in the small town of Oberntief at the time, Brian treasures those years and is always trying to live up to them. While in Germany, he studied full time at the satellite campus of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University near Nurnberg, and as an avid skier, racked up over fifty lift tickets in three years from the Austrian Alps to the Italian Dolomites. If he wasn't flying, studying, or comparing stories over drinks at their remote officers club, he was traveling Europe with his fellow gun pilots. Despite an exciting and very rewarding career thus far, Brian knew it was time to become an actor soon and after seeing the movie Top Gun in Garmisch, requested his final assignment be as close to Hollywood as possible. Within a year, he was based at Ft Ord, CA and immersed himself in Monterey's busy theater community whenever he could.\n\nIn Monterey, he got the part of Vince in Buried Child by falling down 'drunk' on stage during his audition and completing the scene from the stage floor.\n\nIn late 1989, after 10 years of military service, Brian resigned from the Army, sold his new Saab for acting lessons in Hollywood, and made his move there.\n\nOctober 30th 2009 marks both the theatrical release of the new film Boondock Saints 2, All Saints Day and the 20th anniversary of Brian's arrival in Los Angeles.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":"Framingham -  Massachusetts - USA","profile_path":"/v6pTsqgOHE5TldFV63Kr44idQNe.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0537126","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":1347294,"name":"Donald Watkins","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/rMPjEgjxK1NQOmwvkOIIKxhRLk2.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm5060159","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163736,"name":"Tess Oakland","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2035117,"name":"Michael Lee Kimel","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163737,"name":"Ryan Clay Forbes","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163738,"name":"Joshua Powell","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/zW3vDKoOsIhzyW8HoI8jPgCAjNe.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163739,"name":"Thomas Clay Strickland","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/6rquwfQtPoArOZyTmHCBASnZVPj.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163740,"name":"Brad Kitchen","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163741,"name":"Tim Harper","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163742,"name":"Andrew Armstrong","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163744,"name":"Kevin Johnson","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2163745,"name":"Damian Lovello","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":232749,"name":"Nelson Bonilla","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/5LtJKIaeBtzm9u64bIIvYP3cUFc.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm2028052","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1983-12-21","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":1744406,"name":"Shawn Eric Jones","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"Shawn Eric Jones, or Shawn Juan as his family refers to him as, is both an actor and model from Missouri.

He made his feature film debut in Short Term 12 (2013), for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. In 2014, he co-starred in the horror film The Purge: Anarchy and in the Martin Luther King biopic Selma, as civil right activist Jimmie Lee Jackson. Stanfield appeared in the film Dope (2015). He played rapper Snoop Dogg in the biopic about the hip-hop group N.W.A, Straight Outta Compton (2015), and will appear in the upcoming Oliver Stone biopic Snowden (2015).\n\nStanfield was born in San Bernardino, California and grew up in Riverside and Victorville, California. He has said that he \"grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides\". He decided to become an actor when he was 14 years old, when he joined his high school's drama club. He attended the John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center in Los Angeles, where he was signed by an agency manager and began to audition for commercials.\n\nStanfield's first role was in the short film Short Term 12 (2009), which was filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton's thesis project at San Diego State University, and won the Jury Award for U.S. Short Filmmaking at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. A year later, he appeared in the short film Gimme Grace (2010), before he gave up acting for several years. He went on to work a number of different jobs—roof work, gardening, at AT&T, and at a legal marijuana factory—before he was contacted by Cretton to reappear in a feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12, his first feature film. For the duration of the film's production, Stanfield practiced method acting, distancing himself from the other cast members like his character, Marcus. He was the only actor to appear in both the short and feature films.\n\nShort Term 12 won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, and Stanfield was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. The film featured \"Vicious\", a rap song co-written with Milgaten, and \"So You Know What It's Like\", a rap song co-written with Cretton, which a number of Oscar pundits predicted would be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, although it did not ultimately receive a nomination.\n\nIn 2014, Stanfield co-starred in The Purge: Anarchy and Selma, in the latter playing civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson. He is set to appear in James Franco's upcoming film Memoria and in Don Cheadle's Miles Ahead. Stanfield will also star in the fantasy horror thriller film King Ripple, by the Michigan filmmaker Luke Jaden, and the music video for the Run the Jewels song \"Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)\".

He attended the University of California, Los Angeles but dropped out when he was not admitted into the film school in his third year. As an unpaidintern for a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote called Swings. This led to a meeting where he successfully pitched Racing with the Moon (1984).  His first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision. Kloves wrote The Fabulous Baker Boys and also intended it to be his directorial debut. After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989. The Fabulous Baker Boys did reasonably well, but his next shot as writer/director for Flesh and Bone in 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.  Realizing that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adapting Michael Chabon's novel Wonder Boys into a screenplay. Kloves was offered the chance to direct but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work. This was his first try at adapting another work to film. His screenplay was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award after the film's release in 2000.  Warner Bros. sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering to adapt as films. The listing included the first Harry Potter novel, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs. He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. After Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh and eighth installments.  As of 2011, Kloves is working on a film adaptation of Mark Haddon's novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which he will write and direct. He has also a draft written of the yet unproduced fantasy film Akira.","popularity":2.107,"place_of_birth":"Austin - Texas - USA","profile_path":"/nhHzMwSiVse15WF1Qi7xfVBoo7A.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0460141","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1961-01-01","known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":41289,"name":"Lionel Wigram","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"Lionel Wigram (born 1961) is a British film producer and screenplay writer.

Chance","Rip Haight"],"gender":2,"biography":"John Howard Carpenter is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, editor, composer, and occasional actor. Although Carpenter has worked in numerous film genres in his four-decade career, his name is most commonly associated with horror and science fiction.\n\nMost films in Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be viewed as cult classics, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. Cult classics that Carpenter directed include: Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988) and In the Mouth of Madness (1995).\n\nHis films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of steadicam, and distinctive synthesized scores. Carpenter is also notable for having composed or co-composed most of the music of his films; some of them are now considered cult as well, with the main theme of Halloween being considered a part of popular culture. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics. He released his first studio album Lost Themes in 2015, and also won a Saturn Award for Best Music for Vampires (1998).\n\nCarpenter is an outspoken proponent of widescreen filming, and all of his theatrical movies (with the exception of Dark Star and The Ward) were filmed anamorphic with a 2.35:1 or greater aspect ratio. The Ward was shot in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the 35mm Panavision anamorphic format is \"the best movie system there is\", preferring it over both digital and 3D film.\n\nMany of Carpenter's films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features.  Carpenter has been the subject of the documentary film John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies, and American Cinematheque's 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, in 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed Halloween to be \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nIn 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series A History of Horror. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his The Director's Chair series on El Rey Network.\n\nMany filmmakers have been influenced by Carpenter, including James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino ((The Hateful Eight was heavily influenced by The Thing), Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bong Joon-ho, among others. The video game Dead Space 3 is said to be influenced by Carpenter's The Thing, The Fog and Halloween, and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film.","popularity":1.784,"place_of_birth":"Carthage, New York, USA","profile_path":"/jGprVNNSmlJzLNhm2tcdmjquLyL.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000118","homepage":"http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/"},{"birthday":"1969-02-20","known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":84348,"name":"Jason Blum","also_known_as":["Jason Ferus Blum"],"gender":2,"biography":"Jason Ferus Blum (born February 20, 1969) is an American film producer, and both the founder and CEO of Blumhouse Productions.

He was born in New Brighton, South Africa. Kani joined The Serpent Players (a group of actors whose first performance was in the former snake pit of the zoo, hence the name) in Port Elizabeth in 1965 and helped to create many plays that went unpublished but were performed to a resounding reception. These were followed by the more famous Sizwe Banzi is Dead and The Island, co-written with Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona, in the early 1970s. He also received an Olivier nomination for his role in My Children My Africa! Kani's work has been widely performed around the world, including New York, where he and Winston Ntshona won a Tony Award in 1975 for Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island. These two plays were presented in repertory at the Edison Theatre for a total of 52 performances. Nothing but the Truth (2002) was his debut as sole playwright and was first performed in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. This play takes place in post-apartheid South Africa and does not concern the conflicts between whites and blacks, but the rift between blacks who stayed in South Africa to fight apartheid, and those who left only to return when the hated regime folded. It won the 2003 Fleur du Cap Awards for best actor and best new South African play. In the same year he was also awarded a special Obie award for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the USA. Kani is executive trustee of the Market Theatre Foundation, founder and director of the Market Theatre Laboratory and chairman of the National Arts Council of SA.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Kani, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":1.313,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/iOKWcdeCNbEREAWMWIZBy6p805j.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0437689","homepage":null},{"birthday":"2007-08-16","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":1609481,"name":"Seth Carr","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.828,"place_of_birth":" Anaheim, California, USA","profile_path":"/bO4OGAf932dxyW9LRNgHsYra758.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm3695624","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1990-06-15","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":77278,"name":"Denzel Whitaker","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"Denzel Dominique Whitaker (born June 15, 1990) is an American actor, playing key roles in the films The Great Debaters and Training Day, as well as TV shows ER, Brothers &amp; Sisters and The War At Home.

In his earlier years, he played football -- a vocation that stayed with him into his college career. While he was at Saint Mary's College of California, his English professor, Rosemary Graham, suggested that Coogler consider a screenwriting career. Coogler then attended Sacramento State, and later, USC School of Cinematic Arts, eventually directing four short films while there: Locks (2009), Fig (2011), The Sculptor (2011), and Gap (2011). Three of these shorts either won or were nominated for different awards.  Coogler's first feature film was titled Fruitvale, and later Fruitvale Station (2013). It is based on the final 24 hours of Oscar Grant's life, before he was shot and killed by one of Oakland's Fruitvale BART station's police officers, on the first day of 2009. Produced by actor-director Forest Whitaker, the feature starring Michael B. Jordan won many awards. Coogler then directed Creed (2015), a sequel/spin-off of the Rocky movies. It won critical accolades for both him and actor Jordan, who had collaborated with Coogler again.  In early 2016, Coogler was slated to direct and jointly write the script for Marvel Studios' feature film, Black Panther.","popularity":1.73,"place_of_birth":"Oakland, California, USA","profile_path":"/ddGaRFrlDdyR0OBTd1hAMWnfvim.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm3363032","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1151834,"name":"Joe Robert Cole","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":1.153,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/7BShwadFBLSnwPtdZDKzwZC4Mtr.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1963288","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Editing","deathday":null,"id":1141734,"name":"Michael P.

Formally educated in the notorious NYC club scene of the 1980’s, their sartorial obsession and shared sensibility has traversed the worlds of fashion, music, theatre and film.\n\nIn 2014 Kurt and Bart received the Costume Designer’s Guild Award nomination for Excellence in Period Film for their work on the Oscar winning drama DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, starring Mathew McConaughey and Jared Leto.\n\nSTOKER starring Nicole Kidman and Mia Wasikowska was an opportunity to work with internationally acclaimed auteur director Park Chan-wook. Their costume design work was nominated for the 2014 London Film Critics Circle for Technical Achievement .\n\nTheir previous work in film is as varied as the gritty noir OUT OF THE FURNACE starring Christian Bale and directed by Scott Cooper for Relativity, to the dance musical STEP UP 3D directed by Jon M. Chu for Paramount. Kurt and Bart’s filmography includes Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden’s IT’S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY with Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts, Todd Solandz DARK HORSE with Mia Farrow and Selma Blair, Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Freidman’s HOWL with James Franco and John Hamm, Dito Montiel’s FIGHTING with Channing Tatum, Daniel Barnz PHOEBE IN WONDERLAND with Elle Fanning, and John Cameron Mitchell’s notorious SHORTBUS.\n\nTheir early career included designing their own clothing line called Design Asylum and creating costumes for commercials and music videos. They stood out as styling team with an approach as much about pulling fashion looks as it was about designing and building custom pieces to realize a visual image. As stylists, Kurt and Bart have worked with some of the world’s strongest and most prolific image makers, among them, Steven Klein, Herb Ritts, Patrick Demarchelier, Matthew Rolston, Francis Lawrence, Dean Karr, Mark Seliger, and Mary Ellen Mark. They have created lasting images with such music icons as David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Marilyn Manson, Courtney Love, Pink, and Britney Spears.\n\nKurt and Bart most recently designed the costumes for Mockingjay Pt 1 and 2 of the Hunger Games franchise.\n\nMockingjay Pt. 1 will be released Nov 21, 2014","popularity":0.98,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm2005050","homepage":"http://www.kurtandbart.net/"},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":1334183,"name":"Glenn Woodruff","also_known_as":["Glenn 'Woody' Woodruff","Glenn 'Woody' Woodruf","Glen Woodruff","Glenn 'Woody' Woorduff"],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0940429","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":1334184,"name":"Dan Sissons","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0803106","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":1869084,"name":"Houman Eshraghi","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":2015749,"name":"Peter Rzazewski","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":2015750,"name":"Beatrix Schalk","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":2015751,"name":"Jennifer Yee","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":2015752,"name":"Katharina Brand","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","deathday":null,"id":2015755,"name":"Lilia Afsahi","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","deathday":null,"id":1762860,"name":"Ailsa Macmillan","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","deathday":null,"id":2015756,"name":"Jaala Leis Wanless","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","deathday":null,"id":1441272,"name":"Monica Huppert","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0403284","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":1702478,"name":"Howard Lau","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":85120,"name":"Lee Gren","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1297300","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Sound","deathday":null,"id":1562661,"name":"Donald D.

The two subsequently starred in Otto Preminger's hit musical Carmen Jones (1954). In 1957's Island in the Sun, there are hints of an affair between Belafonte's character and Joan Fontaine. The film also starred James Mason, Dandridge, Joan Collins, Michael Rennie, and John Justin. In 1959, he starred in and produced Robert Wise's Odds Against Tomorrow, in which he played a bank robber. He also co–starred with Inger Stevens in The World, the Flesh and the Devil. Belafonte was offered the role of Porgy in Preminger's Porgy and Bess, where he would have once again starred opposite Dandridge, but he refused the role because he objected to its racial stereotyping. Dissatisfied with the film roles available to him, he returned to music during the 1960s. But in the early 1970s Belafonte appeared in more films among which are two with Poitier: Buck and the Preacher (1972) and Uptown Saturday Night (1974). In 1984, Belafonte produced and scored the musical film Beat Street, dealing with the rise of hip–hop culture. Belafonte next starred in a major film again in the mid-1990s, appearing with John Travolta in the race–reverse drama White Man's Burden (1995); and in Robert Altman's jazz age drama Kansas City (1996), the latter of which garnered him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also starred as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in the TV drama Swing Vote (1999). In late 2006, Belafonte appeared in the role of Nelson, a friend of an employee of the Ambassador Hotel played by Anthony Hopkins, in Bobby, Emilio Estevez's ensemble drama about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.  Belafonte's success did not protect him from racial discrimination, particularly in the American South. Belafonte refused to perform there from 1954 until 1961. In 1960, he appeared in a campaign commercial for Democratic Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. Kennedy later named Belafonte cultural advisor to the Peace Corps. At the ACLU of Northern California's annual Bill of Rights Day Celebration In December 2007, Belafonte gave the keynote address and was awarded the Chief Justice Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award. The 2011 Sundance Film Festival featured the documentary film \"Sing Your Song\", a biographical film focusing on Belafonte's contribution to and his leadership in the civil rights movement in America and his endeavors to promote social justice globally.

He went on to study acting at SUNY Purchase where he met aspiring filmmaker Hal Hartley, who cast him as one of the leads in his debut feature \"The Unbelievable Truth,\" an offbeat indie tale where he played a man trying to escape his troubled past. Working with Hartley again on the charming brother-centric dark comedy \"Simple Men,\" Burke caught a major break when Hollywood producers decided that his chiseled jawline was the right one to replace Peter Weller's in the sci-fi/action sequel \"RoboCop 3.\" Despite Burke's efforts, the movie tanked, and he went on to smaller roles in major films, including the lauded Western \"Tombstone\" (1993) and the prison-break movie \"Fled\" (1996). Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation \"Thinner\" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke's leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley's \"No Such Thing\" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama \"Oz\" and the police procedural \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney's first two movies as director, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (2002) and \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary's lead character on the firefighter series \"Rescue Me,\" a part that dovetailed with Burke's real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James \"Chaos\" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries \"Generation Kill\" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama \"Gossip Girl.\" Before long, he was juggling his ongoing \"Law & Order: SVU\" part with regular spots on the military drama \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show \"Person of Interest\" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie \"2 Guns\" (2013).","popularity":0.884,"place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, USA","profile_path":"/ctVRWqY0KfSBIpaGulJMbhyE3jy.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0121559","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1977-08-06","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":77264,"name":"Ashlie Atkinson","also_known_as":[],"gender":1,"biography":"Ashlie Atkinson (born August 6, 1977) is an American stage, film, and television actress.","popularity":1.104,"place_of_birth":"Little Rock - Arkansas - USA","profile_path":"/h0ykP84QXTDLxfzizdQaFXZzzY8.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1534700","homepage":"http://dreamreve.wix.com/ashlieatkinson"},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":2089988,"name":"Jared Johnston","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm5054115","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1968-12-28","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":5353,"name":"Michael J.

At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from a proud and intelligent background. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee's next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She's Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million. Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. Lee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed a neighborhood on a very hot day, and the racial tensions that emerge. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo' Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington. His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee's handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee's next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March. His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994). He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. With pointed political messages, insightful, different and intelligent films, Spike Lee has become a well known political presence. He looks likely to have further success in the film business. Lee is an obsessive New York Knicks fan. He and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, have two children.","popularity":3.272,"place_of_birth":"Atlanta, Georgia, USA","profile_path":"/2KOHXgk2uoRXl6u7V9xpAIo3uay.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000490","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1925067,"name":"David Rabinowitz","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.728,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1925068,"name":"Charlie Wachtel","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.98,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1959-08-31","known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":91585,"name":"Kevin Willmott","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":1.094,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/7B0AixRblLw81tukeWM15zV1K6y.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0932551","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":1201896,"name":"Raymond Mansfield","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1506448","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":1587,"name":"Sean McKittrick","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0572014","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1979-02-21","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":291263,"name":"Jordan Peele","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"Jordan Peele attended the Computer School in I.S. 44 for Junior High School and went on to attend The Calhoun School for high school, graduating in 1997.

She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry.\n\nAdams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work.\n\nNursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Cruel Intentions (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004).\n\nHer role in the low-budget independent film Junebug (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Enchanted (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nAdams next appeared in the major production, Charlie Wilson's War (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as \"Sister James\" in Doubt (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as Amelia Earhart in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in Julie & Julia (2009).

The hometown of Nate Banks in the comic book themed kids' series of novels, The Amazing Adventures of Nate Banks, is named \"Kanigher Falls\". He is the co-creator of Poison Ivy, Black Canary, Wonder Girl, Metal Men, Suicide Squad and The Flash, as well as hundreds of DC War Comics.\n\nHis first (recorded) comics work was for Fox, writing the original Dan Garrett Blue Beetle, and soon after, the best-selling Captain Marvel Adventures, before joining All-American Comics, which would eventually become DC. He wrote the Justice Society, and then became the editor and writer of Wonder Woman, a title he would guide from 1946 all the way to 1968. He also wrote what's often considered the first story of the Silver Age, introducing Barry Allen as the new Flash, created stalwarts like Metal Men, Black Canary and Batman villain Poison Ivy, and at one point or another, wrote probably every single DC hero.\n\nKanigher's greatest success, and most of his output, come from DC's war comics. He introduced perhaps the most memorable war-comics protagonists: Sgt. Frank Rock and the men of Easy Company, the Haunted Tank, GI Robot, The Losers, Enemy Ace, the Creature Commandos and the Unknown Soldier (mostly with frequent collaborators Russ Heath and Joe Kubert on art). His stories were marked by action and a weariness of combat that made his characters seem human, even while they were battling Nazi supermen with metal fists and shooting down airplanes with handguns.","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, USA","profile_path":"/6jmF1hZXhwMTf1C1Pb2HSEwTkWI.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1189825","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1920-02-17","known_for_department":"Crew","deathday":"1996-06-17","id":2137704,"name":"Curt Swan","also_known_as":["Douglas Curtis Swan"],"gender":2,"biography":"Douglas Curtis 'Curt' Swan (1920-1996) was an American comics artist, most associated with Superman during the period fans call the \"Silver Age\" of comic books.

Marisa also has a brother, actor Adam Tomei. As a child, Marisa's mother frequently corrected her speech as to eliminate her heavy Brooklyn accent. As a teen, Marisa attended Edward R. Murrow High School and graduated in the class of 1982. She was one year into her college education at Boston University when she dropped out for a co-starring role on the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns (1956). Her role on that show paved the way for her entrance into film: in 1984, she debuted with a bit part in The Flamingo Kid (1984). Three years later, Marisa became known for her role as Maggie Lawton, Lisa Bonet's college roommate, on the sitcom A Different World (1987).\n\nHer real breakthrough came in 1992, when she co-starred as Joe Pesci's hilariously foul-mouthed, scene-stealing girlfriend in My Cousin Vinny (1992), a performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Later that year, she turned up briefly as a snippy Mabel Normand in director Richard Attenborough's biopic Chaplin (1992), and was soon given her first starring role in Untamed Heart (1993). A subsequent starring role -- and attempted makeover into Audrey Hepburn -- in the romantic comedy Only You (1994) proved only moderately successful.\n\nMarisa's other 1994 role as Michael Keaton's hugely pregnant wife in The Paper (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. Fortunately for Tomei, she was able to rebound the following year with a solid performance as a troubled single mother in Nick Cassavetes' Unhook the Stars (1996) which earned her a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She turned in a similarly strong work in Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), and in 1998 did some of her best work in years as the sexually liberated, unhinged cousin of Natasha Lyonne's Vivian Abramowitz in Tamara Jenkins' Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). Marisa co-starred with Mel Gibson in the hugely successful romantic comedy What Women Want (2000) and during the 2002 movie award season, she proved her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar win was no fluke when she received her second nomination in the same category for the critically acclaimed dark drama, In the Bedroom (2001). She also made a guest appearance on the animated TV phenomenon The Simpsons (1989) as Sara Sloane, a movie star who falls in love with Ned Flanders. In 2006, she went on to do 4 episodes for Rescue Me (2004). She played Angie, the ex-wife of Tommy Calvin (Denis Leary)'s brother Johnny (Dean Winters). At age 42, Marisa took a provocative role in legendary filmmaker Sidney Lumet's melodramatic picture Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007), in which she appeared nude in love scenes with co-stars Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Marisa then took on another provocative role as a stripper in the highly acclaimed film The Wrestler (2008), opposite Mickey Rourke.

At 16, he left Crieff and Morrison Academy to join the Perth Repertory Theatre. His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside Daniel Craig and Alistair McGowan among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in Dennis Potter's 1993 six-part Channel 4 series \"Lipstick on Your Collar\" (1993).\n\nHis first notable role was that of Alex Law in Shallow Grave (1994), directed by Danny Boyle, written by John Hodge and produced by Andrew MacDonald. This was followed by The Pillow Book (1996) and Trainspotting (1996), the latter of which brought him to the public's attention.\n\nHe is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation, and portrays Obi-wan Kenobi in the first three Star Wars episodes. McGregor is married to French production designer Eve Mavrakis, whom he met while working on the TV show \"Kavanagh QC\" (1995). They married in France in the summer of 1995 and have two daughters, Clara Mathilde and Esther Rose. McGregor has formed a production company with friends Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Called Natural Nylon, they hope it will make innovative films that do not conform to Hollywood standards.","popularity":3.749,"place_of_birth":"Perth, Scotland, UK","profile_path":"/pTyXmuOIcbzkwxstOKBqMoGStFg.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000191","homepage":"http://ewanmcgregor.net/"},{"birthday":"1982-04-05","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":39459,"name":"Hayley Atwell","also_known_as":["Hayley Elizabeth Atwell ","Hayley Attwell ","헤일리 앳웰"],"gender":1,"biography":"Hayley Elizabeth Atwell (born 5 April 1982) is an English actress.","popularity":4.49,"place_of_birth":"London, England","profile_path":"/6BhmZl0BaC0qTamFH7n4hfjqMqY.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm2017943","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":1901375,"name":"Bronte Carmichael","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"Bronte Carmichael is a British actress who plays Madeline Robin in Disney's Christopher Robin and Chloe Morrell in On Chesil Beach.

After beginning her career in theatre, Anderson achieved international recognition for her role as Special Agent Dana Scully on the American television series The X-Files. Her film work includes The House of Mirth (2000), The Mighty Celt (2005), The Last King of Scotland (2006), and two X-Files films, The X-Files (1998) and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008).\n\nAnderson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary Anderson (née Lane), a computer analyst, and Edward Anderson, who owned a film post-production company.Her father was of English descent, while her mother was of Irish and German ancestry. Soon after her birth, her family moved to Puerto Rico for 15 months; her family then moved to the United Kingdom where she lived until she was 11 years old. She lived for five years in Rosebery Gardens, Crouch End, London, and for 15 months in Albany Road, Stroud Green, London, so that her father could attend the London Film School.\n\nShe was a pupil of Coleridge Primary School. When Anderson was 11 years old, her family moved again, this time to Grand Rapids, Michigan. She attended Fountain Elementary and then City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis on the humanities; she graduated in 1986.\n\nAlong with other actors (notably Linda Thorson and John Barrowman) Anderson is bidialectal. With her English accent and background, Anderson was mocked and felt out of place in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwest accent. To this day, her accent depends on her location — for instance, in an interview with Jay Leno she spoke in an American accent, but shifted it for an interview with Michael Parkinson.\n\nAnderson was interested in marine biology, but began acting her freshman year in high school productions, and later in community theater, and served as a student intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre & School of Theatre Arts. She attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago (formerly the Goodman School of Drama), where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990. She also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program at Cornell University.\n\nAnderson's brother died in 2011 of a brain tumor, at the age of 30.\n\nAnderson married her first husband, Clyde Klotz, The X-Files series assistant art director, on New Year's Day, 1994, in Hawaii in a Buddhist ceremony. They had a daughter, Piper Maru (born September 1994), for whom Chris Carter named the X-Files episode of the same name, and divorced in 1997.] In December 2004, Anderson married Julian Ozanne, a documentary filmmaker, on Lamu Island, off the coast of Kenya. Anderson announced their separation on April 21, 2006.\n\nAnderson and former boyfriend, Mark Griffiths, have two sons: Oscar, born November 2006 and Felix, born October 2008. She ended their relationship in 2012. In March 2012, Anderson told Out magazine about her past relationship with a girl while in high school.\n\nIn 1997, she was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World. Askmen listed her at No. 6 on their Top 7: '90s Sex Symbols.

At Yale, he was a Samuel F. B. Morse College Graduate Fellow. He was also a nominee for the Irene Ryan Award, a prize conferred upon the most promising young actors in the United States. While still at Yale, he was an instructor at the well-known performing arts camp, Stagedoor Manor. After his training, he appeared on stage with several resident theatre companies, including The Guthrie Theater, The Kennedy Center For The Performing Arts, The Yale Repertory Theater, and on Broadway in the Tony Award-Winning Amadeus. Following Amadeus, Melamed entered what he called \"a period of personal darkness\", during which he effectively stopped acting on stage. At the same time, he became established as a vocal actor, and continued to do film work.\n\nMelamed's voice became a familiar presence on television, serving as the sound of the Olympics, Mercedes Benz, CBS Sports, USA Network, the Superbowl, and numerous commercials and television programs. He became known within the industry as a voice actor, appearing in the Grand Theft Auto series, and dubbing several actors' entire performances in films. But it was for his portrayal of \"sensitive\" villain Sy Ableman, in Joel and Ethan Coen's 2009 film, A Serious Man, which was nominated for Best Picture, at the 2010 Academy Awards, that he became most widely known. About that character, Film Confessional said, \"Sy Ableman is as great a contemporary movie villain as The Joker, Hans Landa, or Anton Chigurh...The character Fred Melamed contrives is the year's most brilliant force of destruction.\"\n\nFor his somewhat titular performance in A Serious Man, Melamed, along with the Coen Brothers, the film's Ensemble and Casting Directors, won Film Independent's Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award. New York Magazine listed Melamed's work as among the Best Performances of 2009, and Empire called Sy Ableman \"One of The Best Alternative Coen Characters of All Time\".

Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999, he was cast in his first major role, playing Legolas in The Lord of the Rings (2001–2003). He had originally auditioned for the part of Faramir, who doesn't appear until the second movie but the director, Peter Jackson, cast him as Legolas instead.\n\nBloom met American actress Kate Bosworth outside a coffee shop in 2002, where he was introduced to her by a mutual friend. He met her again at the premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers later that year. The two had an \"on-and-off relationship\" from 2002 until splitting up in September 2006. In late 2007, Bloom began dating Australian model Miranda Kerr. The couple's engagement was announced on June 21, 2010.\n\nBloom has said that he tries \"not to exclude [himself] from real life as much as possible\". He is a Manchester United fan and lives in London. During filming in Morocco for Kingdom of Heaven, Bloom rescued and adopted a dog, Sidi (a black Saluki mix with a white mark on his chest). Bloom is a practising Buddhist. In 2004, he became a full member of Soka Gakkai International, a lay Buddhist association affiliated with the teachings of Nichiren. Bloom has also been a part of Global Green, an environmental company, since the early 2000s. As part of his environmental involvement, he has renovated his London home to use solar panels, incorporate recycled materials, and utilize energy efficient lightbulbs. Bloom has been approached by UNICEF to act as an international ambassador.","popularity":3.656,"place_of_birth":"Canterbury, Kent, England, UK","profile_path":"/kKWJlX2tcjqceSfUxnV7Jle5Kt.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0089217","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1985-03-26","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":116,"name":"Keira Knightley","also_known_as":["Keira Christina Knightley","Кира Найтли","เคียรา ไนต์ลีย์","姬拉·麗莉","キーラ・ナイトレイ","키이라 나이틀리","كيرا نايتلي","Кіра Найтлі"],"gender":1,"biography":"Keira Christina Knightley (born 26 March 1985) is an English actress and model.

His siblings are Janine, Claire, Diane and Steven. His father was of Polish descent and worked as a nuclear physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1967 the Verbinski family moved to Southern California, where a young Gregor grew up in the town of La Jolla.\n\nGregor was an active Boy Scout and surfed regularly. He went to Torrey Pines Elementary, Muirlands Junior High, and La Jolla High School before attending UCLA Film School. Verbinski graduated with his BFA in Film from UCLA in 1987.\n\nVerbinski was active in several L.A. rock bands early in his career. His first band was Thelonius Monster, which included drummer Danny Heifetz. He also played in the Daredevils, Bulldozer, The Drivers, and the all-star band The Cylon Boys Choir.\n\nHis first films were a series of 8 mm films called \"The Driver Files\" circa 1979, when he was a young teen. Although most associate Verbinski with feature films, he started his career directing music videos for bands like Bad Religion, NOFX, 24-7 Spyz and Monster Magnet working at Palomar Pictures. This was not surprising to his friends in Los Angeles, since he had been in various punk and rock bands; the Daredevils, for instance, included then-departed member of Bad Religion Brett Gurewitz.\n\nVerbinski moved from music videos to commercials, where he worked for many brand names including Nike, Coca-Cola, Canon, Skittles and United Airlines. One of his most famous commercials was for Budweiser, featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in commercials, Verbinski won four Clio Awards and one Cannes Advertising Silver Lion.\n\nAfter completing a short film, The Ritual (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his feature film directing debut with his comedy flick, Mouse Hunt. The film was a hit globally and he soon followed up the success with the action/comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. The film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million domestically which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to its moderately low $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake The Ring (2002), which struck gold globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also had a directorial hand in The Time Machine that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted Simon Wells. Verbinski directed some of the underground Morlock sequences and is given a Thanks to credit in the film.\n\nHe then directed the very successful Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which earned over $600 million at the international box office.\n\nHis next film was The Weather Man which starred Nicolas Cage. The film received mixed to positive reviews but was a box office failure.\n\nIn March 2005 he started filming the sequels Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The former then became his biggest success so far, becoming the third film ever to gross over $1 billion at the international box office.","popularity":1.786,"place_of_birth":"Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA","profile_path":"/bV0rGSPrK4AUvODjB3zMAwDdeIf.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0893659","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1945-09-21","known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":770,"name":"Jerry Bruckheimer","also_known_as":[" Jerome Leon Bruckheimer ","Джери Брукхаймър"],"gender":2,"biography":"​American film and television producer Jerome Leon \"Jerry\" Bruckheimer has achieved great success in the genres of action, drama, and science fiction.

He competed in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions that year and won.\n\nWolpert began his game show producing career working for U.S. quiz scandal figure Dan Enright in Canada. He later worked as a producer and creator of game shows for Chuck Barris Productions and Goodson-Todman Productions. While at Goodson-Todman, he served as producer of The Price is Right from 1972 until 1978 and also created the short-lived game show Double Dare for CBS.\n\nWolpert left Goodson-Todman to form his own production company, and his first game show was the 1979 series Whew! for CBS. Wolpert produced the series with Burt Sugarman for most of its run, and the series has gained a cult following over the years. Whew! was canceled in 1980 and Wolpert didn't return to television with a series until January 1983, despite shooting several pilots in the interim. On January 3, 1983, Wolpert's Hit Man debuted on NBC with Peter Tomarken, who had never hosted a series before, as its host. Like most of Wolpert's productions, Hit Man was short-lived and left the air after thirteen weeks.\n\nFive years later, Wolpert returned to daytime television with the series Blackout for CBS. Debuting on January 4, 1988 in place of the long-running hit The $25,000 Pyramid, Blackout never found an audience as, among other reasons, many Pyramid fans protested the cancellation. The Bob Goen-hosted Blackout ended after thirteen weeks of episodes and was replaced by The $25,000 Pyramid.\n\nIn 1990 Wolpert launched a new series on the Lifetime network based on a pilot he had shot in 1981 with Tomarken as host. On February 5, 1990, Rodeo Drive debuted with comedienne Louise DuArt hosting. Again, however, Wolpert was behind a short lived series and Rodeo Drive ended its run on August 31 of that year; the show had only aired twelve weeks of new episodes prior to that and had been in reruns until the program was removed from Lifetime's lineup.\n\nAfter a hiatus, Wolpert returned to the Goodson Productions team and produced a new Price is Right series for Goodson and Paramount Television. The New Price is Right debuted in syndication in September 1994, with Wolpert producing. But as with Wolpert's previous three series, ratings for The New Price is Right were lacking and it resulted in a cancellation after sixteen weeks in January 1995.\n\nIn 1996 Wolpert and The Family Channel teamed up for two series. One was Wait 'til You Have Kids, another short-lived series based on The Parent Game, a series produced by Wolpert's previous employer Chuck Barris. The other was the popular Shopping Spree, which ran for nearly two years and was Wolpert's longest-running game show in his company's history. After Shopping Spree went off the air in August 1998, Wolpert's company stopped producing programming. He was executive producer of the 1998 version of Match Game. Despite having worked for Goodson during the 1970's, he didn't work on the 1970's version of that show.\n\nMore recently, Wolpert has turned to screenwriting, writing the script for The Count of Monte Cristo (2002) and receiving a story credit for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003).\n\nWolpert has also made some acting appearances. He played the OB-GYN who tells Diane Keaton she is pregnant in Father of the Bride 2.\n\nIn the 2010-11 season, Wolpert is listed as a consultant during the credits of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and had some input in that season's format changes.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jay Wolpert, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":0.98,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0938684","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":1719,"name":"Jennifer Alessi","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.694,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1198012","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1959-12-29","known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":1720,"name":"Ronna Kress","also_known_as":[],"gender":1,"biography":"Ronna Kress was born on December 29, 1959 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

Kyle","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"Kyle and frequent collaborator Chris Yost are perhaps best known for the creation of mutant character X-23, teenage female clone of Wolverine. In 2003, Kyle and Yost co-wrote the episodes of X-Men: Evolution that introduced X-23 to the X-Men: Evolution universe. Marvel executives were impressed with X-23’s reception on TV, and subsequently asked Yost and Kyle to adapt the character into comics, first by writing the character into a six issue eponymous mini-series, and then by taking over writing chores (as of issue #20) on the New X-Men (formerly New X-Men: Academy X) title, bringing X-23 in as a regular character. The success of X-23's first miniseries (X-23: Innocence Lost) prompted Marvel to order a second six-issue miniseries with Kyle and Yost at the helm, titled X-23: Target X.\n\nKyle and Yost concluded their stint on the New X-Men title after the events of \"X-Men: Messiah Complex\" when the title turned into Young X-Men. Chris Yost and Kyle co-wrote the revamped X-Force with Clayton Crain on pencils; the cast featured Wolverine, Warpath, Wolfsbane, and X-23 as black ops agents on assassination missions per the orders of Cyclops. The series ended in 2010 and was replaced by Uncanny X-Force, written by Rick Remender.","popularity":0.817,"place_of_birth":"USA","profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1219736","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1973-02-21","known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":109542,"name":"Christopher Yost","also_known_as":["Christopher L.

The Scottish team which consisted of Paul Westwood, Ronald Brewster, Steve Still and David Murdoch finished 8-1 after the round robin, and defeated Sweden's Henrik Edlund and then Germany's Daniel Herberg to win the championship.\n\nBrewster has skipped Scotland to two European Mixed titles, in 2006 and in 2009.\n\nBrewster has been a frequent participant in World Curling Tour events, perhaps more so than the more successful Scottish teams. He has won a total of six WCT events, all European events. He has played in 12 Grand Slam events, advancing to the quarterfinals on five occasions (but never further).\n\nIn 2002, Brewster was invited to play in his first World championship. He was an alternate for the Warwick Smith team which won a bronze medal in 2002. Brewster won his first Scottish men's title in 2011, and represented Scotland at the 2011 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, finishing second in the round robin and winning the silver in the final against Canada's Jeff Stoughton.\n\nTom is now the Ice rink manager at Curl Aberdeen .

Avoiding competition with his father, he quit his job as broadcast journalist after a short time.\n\nStudied a few years at Northern Kentucky University. Failed to join the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He came to acting when his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small part in a feature film. After that, he moved to L.A. in 1982 and tried a whole year to get a role while he slept in a friend's closet. His first movie, together with Charlie Sheen, stayed unreleased but got him the producers' attention for later contracts.","popularity":5.482,"place_of_birth":"Lexington, Kentucky, USA","profile_path":"/z4SBfpKDThuQY0FsvDbajcooBdA.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000123","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1625557,"name":"Olivia Milch","also_known_as":[],"gender":1,"biography":"","popularity":1.532,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm6035700","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1929-07-10","known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":"2015-12-25","id":1885,"name":"George Clayton Johnson","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGeorge Clayton Johnson (born July 10, 1929 in Cheyenne, Wyoming) is an American science fiction writer most famous for co-writing the novel Logan's Run with William F.

He grew up loving comic books with the ambition to become a comic-book creator himself, and later become a professional comic book illustrator who in the mid-1970s helped invent a dynamic new look and intriguing new characters for the moribund “X-Men” comics, paving the way for what became America’s most popular comic books and a billion-dollar movie empire.\n\nFollowing his school graduation, Cockrum joined the United States Navy for six years. After his discharge in the early 1970s, Mr. Cockrum moved to New York, where he worked as an inker, who refines the art of the original artist, called a penciller. He did this for Murphy Anderson, who created the modern look of Superman, Batman, Flash and other characters at DC Comics. Clifford Meth, who has written extensively about comic-book art, said Mr. Cockrum created a new look for superheroes, featuring wide shoulder lapels, big belts and buccaneer boots.\n\nDC made him the first artist, or penciller, in redefining the DC team the Legion of Super-Heroes. His costumes and style for the group persisted into the 1980s. After a dispute with DC, Mr. Cockrum moved to its arch-competitor, Marvel. Though the company contended it owed him nothing because he worked as freelancer, it paid him $200,000 and royalties for one character, Nightcrawler, his earliest, according to The Comics Journal. The terms were not officially revealed. While not confirming or denying the $200,000 figure, Mr. Adams said Mr. Cockrum deserved more. “They took his characters and made an industry out of them,” he said.\n\nHe worked less often as his health deteriorated, and died due to complications from diabetes.","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":"Pendleton, Oregon, USA","profile_path":"/mrglhlJzipPgh71tM0QWiCdWAm9.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm1079211","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":2147544,"name":"Jeremy Johnson","also_known_as":[],"gender":2,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm4343567","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1954-02-18","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":8891,"name":"John Travolta","also_known_as":["Джон Траволта","جون ترافولتا","ジョン・トラボルタ","존 트래볼타","จอห์น ทราโวลตา","约翰·特拉沃尔塔"],"gender":2,"biography":"John Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954) is an American actor, film producer, dancer, and singer.

Travolta has twice been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The first, for his role in Saturday Night Fever and the second for Pulp Fiction. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance in Get Shorty.\n\nTravolta, the youngest of six children, was born and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, an inner-ring suburb of New York City. His father, Salvatore Travolta, was a semi-professional football player turned tire salesman and partner in a tire company. His mother, Helen Cecilia, was an actress and singer who had appeared in The Sunshine Sisters, a radio vocal group, and acted and directed before becoming a high school drama and English teacher.

Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, Nesbitt grew up in the nearby village of Broughshane, before moving to Coleraine, County Londonderry. He wanted to become a teacher, like his father, so began a degree in French at the University of Ulster. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical Up on the Roof (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in Hear My Song (1991).\n\nNesbitt got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama Cold Feet (1998–2003), which won him a British Comedy Award, a Television and Radio Industries Club Award, and a National Television Award. His first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer \"Pig\" Finn in Waking Ned (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, Nesbitt was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In Lucky Break (2001), he made his debut as a film lead playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played Ivan Cooper in the television film Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 shootings in Derry. A departure from his previous \"cheeky chappie\" roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a British Independent Film Award and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.\n\nNesbitt has also starred in Murphy's Law (2001–2007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy—a role that was created for him by writer Colin Bateman.

In 2006, after several  guest roles on both sides of the Tasman, Stephen landed the part of  Sharpie in the second series of the 2 time Logie Award winning drama  Love My Way. This was closely followed in 2008 by a leading guest role  on Channel 7's long running Australian medical drama All Saints, a role  that showed his depth and versatility as a dramatic actor.\n\nBut it  is his comedic ability that has Stephen in high demand on screen in  both New Zealand and Australia. Stints on Nickelodeans The GO Show and  ABC's Review with Miles Barlow only confirmed that status.\n\nHis  strong resonant voice has also seen Stephen become one of Australasia's  top Voice actors. These skills have been used to promote some of  Australia &amp; New Zealand's top companies and products.

S. Lewis - they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.  After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.  \n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature - or, more precisely, of high fantasy.  In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009. -

Burns' works are treasure troves of archival materials; he skillfully utilizes period music and footage, photographs, periodicals and ordinary people's correspondence, the latter often movingly read by seasoned professional actors in a deliberate attempt to get away from a \"Great Man\" approach to history. Like most non-fiction filmmakers, Burns wears many hats on his projects, often serving as writer, cinematographer, editor and music director in addition to producing and directing. He achieved his apotheosis with The Civil War (1990), a phenomenally popular 11-hour documentary that won two Emmys and broke all previous ratings records for public TV. The series' companion coffee table book--priced at a hefty $50--sold more than 700,000 copies. The audio version, narrated by Burns, was also a major best-seller. In the final accounting, \"The Civil War\" became the first documentary to gross over $100 million. Not surprisingly, it has become perennial fund-raising programming for public TV stations around the country. Burns arrived upon the scene with the Oscar-nominated Brooklyn Bridge (1981), a nostalgic chronicle of the construction of the fabled edifice. The film was more widely seen when rebroadcast on PBS the following year. Though Burns has made other nonfiction films for theatrical release, notably an acclaimed and ambiguous portrait of Depression-era Louisiana governor Huey Long (1985), PBS would prove to be his true home. He cast a probing eye on such American subjects as The Statue of Liberty (1985), The Congress (1988) (PBS), painter Thomas Hart Benton (1988) (PBS) and early radio with Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio (1991) (PBS). Burns returned to long-form documentary with his most ambitious project to date, an 18-hour history of Baseball (1994), which aired on PBS in the fall of 1994. He approached the national pastime as a template for understanding changes in modern American society. Ironically, this was the only baseball on the air at the time, as the players and owners were embroiled in a bitter strike.","popularity":0.715,"place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York, USA","profile_path":"/AgJqC8MnQcORYeugEDhG8WeLjBw.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0122741","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Writing","deathday":null,"id":1035127,"name":"Dayton Duncan","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0241957","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Crew","deathday":null,"id":2142452,"name":"Albert Nolasco","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Crew","deathday":null,"id":1978728,"name":"Kzar Torres","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":2142478,"name":"Allissoon Lockhart","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Directing","deathday":null,"id":2142479,"name":"Dillon Neaman","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Crew","deathday":null,"id":1759881,"name":"Kimberly Lennox","also_known_as":[],"gender":1,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Art","deathday":null,"id":2142494,"name":"Emily Kwong","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":1739881,"name":"Anthea Strangis","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":2142495,"name":"Jill Hahn","also_known_as":[],"gender":0,"biography":"","popularity":0.6,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":null,"adult":false,"imdb_id":"","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":2142496,"name":"Edward V.

He has been cited as an influence by a number of successful actors. In addition to leading and central supporting roles in big-budget Hollywood films, Oldman has frequently acted in independent films and television shows. Aside from acting, he directed, wrote and co-produced Nil by Mouth, a film partially based on his own childhood, and served as a producer on several films.\n\nAmong other accolades, Oldman has received Emmy-, Screen Actors Guild-, BAFTA- and Independent Spirit Award nominations for his acting work, and has been described as one of the greatest actors never nominated for an Academy Award. His contributions to the science fiction genre have won him a Saturn Award, with a further two nominations. He was also nominated for the 1997 Palme d'Or and won two BAFTA Awards for his filmmaking on Nil By Mouth.

A highly respected theatre actor, Gambon is recognised for his role in The Singing Detective and for his role as Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter film series, replacing the late actor Richard Harris. Gambon was born in Cabra, Dublin during World War II. His father, Edward Gambon, was an engineer, and his mother, Mary, was a seamstress. His father decided to seek work in the rebuilding of London, and so the family moved to Mornington Crescent in North London, when Gambon was five. His father had him made a British citizen - a decision that would later allow Michael to receive an actual, rather than honorary, knighthood. Gambon married Anne Miller when he was 22, but has always been secretive about his personal life, responding to one interviewer's question about her: \"What wife?\" The couple lived near Gravesend, Kent, where she has a workshop. While filming Gosford Park, Gambon brought Philippa Hart on to the set and introduced her to co-stars as his girlfriend. When the affair was revealed in 2002, he moved out of the marital home and bought a bachelor pad. In February 2007, it was revealed that Hart was pregnant with Gambon's child, and gave birth to son, Michael, in May 2007. On 22 June 2009 she gave birth to her second child, a boy named William, who is Gambon's third child. Gambon is a qualified private pilot and his love of cars led to his appearance on the BBC's Top Gear programme. Gambon raced the Suzuki Liana and was driving so aggressively that it went round the last corner of his timed lap on two wheels. The final corner of the Dunsfold Park track has been named \"Gambon\" in his honour.","popularity":2.705,"place_of_birth":"Cabra, Dublin, Ireland","profile_path":"/k6VxRs7xcG6DLEVM1izjb3UWSyC.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0002091","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1959-04-15","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":7056,"name":"Emma Thompson","also_known_as":["엠마 톰슨"],"gender":1,"biography":"Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British actress, comedian and screenwriter.

He has received two Golden Globe Awards and has also been nominated on four occasions.\n\nCarrey began stand-up comedy in 1979, performing at Yuk Yuk's in Toronto, Ontario. After gaining prominence in 1981, he began working at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles where he was soon noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who immediately signed him to open his tour performances.\n\nCarrey, long interested in film and television, developed a close friendship with comedian Damon Wayans, which landed him a role in the sketch comedy hit In Living Color, in which he portrayed various characters during the show's 1990 season. Having had little success in television movies and several low-budget films, Carrey was cast as the title character in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective which premiered in February, 1994, making more than $72 million domestically. The film spawned a sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995), in which he reprised the role of Ventura.\n\nHigh profile roles followed when he was cast as Stanley Ipkiss in The Mask (1994) for which he gained a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, and as Lloyd Christmas in the comedy film Dumb and Dumber (1994).

Harrison Ford’s career started in 1964 when he travelled to California in search of a voice-over job. He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in various films.  Through the 60’s Harrison worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke, Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style.  It wasn’t until 1967 that Harrison received his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter. This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Harrison’s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George Lucas.  This was a turning point in Harrison’s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.  Since his most famous roles in the Star Wars Trilogy and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford has starred in over 40 films.  Many criticize his recent work, saying his performances have been lackluster leading to commercially disappointing films.  Harrison has always worked hard to protect his off-screen private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quite.  He has a total of five children including one recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart. In addition to acting Harrison Ford is passionate about environmental conservation, aviation, and archeology.","popularity":7.37,"place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","profile_path":"/7CcoVFTogQgex2kJkXKMe8qHZrC.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000148","homepage":null},{"birthday":"1988-04-30","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":224513,"name":"Ana de Armas","also_known_as":["Ana Celia de Armas","Ana Celia de Armas Caso","아나 디 아르마스","Ана де Армас"],"gender":1,"biography":"Ana de Armas was born in Cuba on April 30, 1988.

He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.  ","popularity":3.733,"place_of_birth":"South Shields, County Durham, England, UK","profile_path":"/oTAL0z0vsjipCruxXUsDUIieuhk.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0000631","homepage":"http://www.rsafilms.com/"},{"birthday":"1954-01-02","known_for_department":"Acting","deathday":null,"id":96765,"name":"Cynthia Sikes","also_known_as":[],"gender":1,"biography":"","popularity":0.98,"place_of_birth":null,"profile_path":"/quFlIHnZDU2PcbDEhTtkE9lzS4h.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0005427","homepage":null},{"birthday":null,"known_for_department":"Production","deathday":null,"id":956249,"name":"Steven P.

He directed and produced the 1958 TV special An Evening With Fred Astaire, which won nine Emmy Awards.\n\nYorkin was born Alan David Yorkin in Washington, Pennsylvania. He earned a degree in engineering from Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In 1956, he became the producer and director of Tennessee Ernie Ford's NBC comedy/variety program, The Ford Show.\n\nIn 1963, Yorkin joined Norman Lear to form Tandem Productions, which, at first, produced several films in the 1960s to 1971 with such major studios like United Artists and Warner Bros., and later produced many of the decade's hit sitcoms, such as All in the Family, Maude, Good Times, and Sanford and Son.\n\nIn 1999, he and Lear were awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of excellence and innovation in creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.\n\nAfter his split with Lear, Yorkin went on to form Bud Yorkin Productions. His first sitcom after the split was the unsuccessful Sanford and Son spin-off sitcom Grady. In 1976, he formed TOY Productions with Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein (who produced Sanford and Son from 1974–1977), but their two hits were What's Happening!! and Carter Country.\n\nYorkin's film directing credits include The Thief Who Came to Dinner , Divorce American Style and Inspector Clouseau (film) of the Pink Panther series.\n\nYorkin is the father of television writer and producer Nicole Yorkin.
