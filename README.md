# Data Provenance 
This repository contains the scraping scripts used to grab data for the two uses cases in the companion Origraph paper. 

The user must obtain an API key in order to obtain data with these scripts. The three sources of data are Twitter, ProPublic, The Movie Database, and BechdelTest. All services except for BechdelTest require a user API to use their API.
