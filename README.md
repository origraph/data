# Data Provenance 
This repository contains the scraping scripts used to grab data for the two use cases in the companion Origraph paper. 

The user must obtain an API key in order to use these scripts. The sources of data are Twitter, ProPublica, The Movie Database, and BechdelTest. All services except for BechdelTest require an api key to use their API.
